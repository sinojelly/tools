详细介绍和用法: 
Blat is a Public Domain Windows console utility that sends the contents of a file in an e-mail message using the SMTP protocol. Blat is useful for creating scripts where mail has to be sent automatically (CGI, backups, etc.), or just as a quick way to send a file or message quickly from the command line. It will store relevant configuration details in the registry for ease of use. Optionally, blat can also attach multiple binary files to your message and comes with a variety of different switches including HTML format, subject line, bcc, return receipt and many others.
